### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

_Bar chart but chinese bar is too wide in respect to other bars, scale is different for different languages._

## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_Not easy for human to read, data is not well represented. Not clear what dimension represents which variable. colours are very similar_

## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_Points are cluttered and hard to distinguish, very small hard to read the points, no scale, no key for the colours_

## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_Not clear which variable occupies which area, no clear scale (e.g. continents? countries?)_

# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

A wide format has values that do not repeat in the first column. A long format has values that do repeat in the first column. 

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?

It is wide

How many observations are there in the data set?

there are five observations


## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = 2:12, 
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    ) %>%
  view()

```


## Exercise 3

# Write your code for Exercise 4 here



```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- staff_long %>%
#  mutate(year = ______(year))
```
